# final_project_Binary-Classification-of-Insurance-Cross-Selling

This repository contains code and resources for the Kaggle Playground Series competition on predicting customer responses to automobile insurance offers.

## Overview
Welcome to the 2024 Kaggle Playground Series! We plan to continue in the spirit of previous playgrounds, providing interesting an approachable datasets for our community to practice their machine learning skills, and anticipate a competition each month.

Your Goal: The objective of this competition is to predict which customers respond positively to an automobile insurance offer.

## Data
Dataset Description
The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Health Insurance Cross Sell Prediction Data dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.

## Files
- train.csv - the training dataset; Response is the binary target
- test.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict the probability of Response for each row
- sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format
